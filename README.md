# Parse the Metadata from an SAP OData Service

This is a work in progress!

Parse the metadata XML describing an SAP OData service and generate basic Rust entities for each EDM type:

* [x] `ComplexType`
* [x] `EntityType`
* [ ] `FunctionImport`

> ***TODO***
>
> Currently when generating a Rust `struct`, only the `Name` and `Type` properties are extracted from the XML `<EntityType>` declaration.<br>
> Consider how the other XML attribute values and SAP annotations could be made available within the Rust `struct`.

## Usage

### Declare Build Dependency

In the `Cargo.toml` of your application, define an entry in `[build-dependencies]` that points to the `parse-sap-odata` crate:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
parse-sap-odata = "^1.1.0"
```

Your app will also (almost certainly) require these dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
rust_decimal = "^1.30"
uuid = "^1.4"
chrono = "^0.4"
```

### Create a Build Script

In your app's build script (`build.rs`), run the generator for your desired OData service:

```rust
use parse_sap_odata::utils::parse_odata::gen_src;

fn main() {
    gen_src(
        metadata_file_name: "gwsample_basic",
        namespace: "GWSAMPLE_BASIC"
    );
}
```

See the Rust documentation page for [build scripts](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) for more information.

### XML Input Files

All metadata XML for the OData services your app consumes must be located in the `./odata` directory immediately under your app's top level directory.

Using the above example from SAP's Dev Center server, the [OData metadata XML](https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/$metadata) for service [`GWSAMPLE_BASIC`](https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/) must be located in file [`./odata/gwsample_basic.xml`](./build_test_crate/odata/gwsample_basic.xml)

### Generated Output

If `cargo` detects a `build.rs` file in your project/crate, then it automatically populates the environment variable `OUT_DIR`.
This variable then points to the directory into which all build script output is written.

The default directory name is `target/debug/build/<your_package_name>/out`, and this is where you can find the generated `struct` declarations for the OData service.

You can specify your own value for `OUT_DIR` either by passing a value to `cargo`'s `--out_dir` flag, or by defining your own location in a `config.toml` file in the `./.cargo` directory.
See [Cargo Configuration](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html) for more details.

All generated `struct`s implement `#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default)]`

---

## Referencing Generated Output

Since `cargo` runs the build script before compiling your application code, the source code of your application can reference the generated `structs` like this:

```rust
include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/gwsample_basic.rs"));

fn main() {
    let bp: BusinessPartner = Default::default();
    println!("{:#?}", bp);
}
```

---

## OData Complex Types

In the event an Entity Type definition uses a complex type, then the complex type is first created as a Rust `struct`.
The field in Rust `struct` that has this complex type is then defined using this `struct`.

An example of this is the `Address` property.

```xml
<EntityType Name="BusinessPartner" sap:content-version="1">
  <Key>
    <PropertyRef Name="BusinessPartnerID"/>
  </Key>
  <Property Name="Address" Type="GWSAMPLE_BASIC.CT_Address" Nullable="false"/>

  <!-- SNIP -->

</EntityType>
```

The Rust `struct` name is generated by trimming the namespace qualifier and (if present) the `CT_` prefix

```xml
<ComplexType Name="CT_Address">
  <Property Name="City" Type="Edm.String" MaxLength="40" sap:label="City" sap:semantics="city"/>
  <Property Name="PostalCode" Type="Edm.String" MaxLength="10" sap:label="Postal Code" sap:semantics="zip"/>
  <Property Name="Street" Type="Edm.String" MaxLength="60" sap:label="Street" sap:semantics="street"/>
  <Property Name="Building" Type="Edm.String" MaxLength="10" sap:label="Building"/>
  <Property Name="Country" Type="Edm.String" MaxLength="3" sap:label="Country" sap:semantics="country"/>
  <Property Name="AddressType" Type="Edm.String" MaxLength="2" sap:label="Address Type"/>
</ComplexType>
```

So the above XML definition becomes:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default)]
pub struct Address {
    pub address_type: Option<String>,
    pub building: Option<String>,
    pub city: Option<String>,
    pub country: Option<String>,
    pub postal_code: Option<String>,
    pub street: Option<String>,
}
```

## OData "Simple" Complex Types

The metadata for the `GWSAMPLE_BASIC` OData service contains the following complex type:

```xml
<ComplexType Name="CT_String">
  <Property Name="String" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="false" sap:creatable="false" sap:updatable="false" sap:sortable="false" sap:filterable="false"/>
</ComplexType>
```

Allowing for the current situation in which additional attribute values and SAP Annotations are not preserved, this particular type turns out not to be complex at all &mdash; its just a `String`.
In such cases, fields declared to be of these "simple" complex types (such as `CT_String`), are collapsed down to the Rust native type of the single inner property &mdash; which in this example is simply a `String`.

---

## TODOs

1. Consider fetching the metadata at build time &mdash; but this raises the question of whether allowing a build script to look outside its sandbox is an anti-pattern...
1. Support Function Imports

## Testing this Crate Locally

### Prerequisites

You must already have a userid and password for the SAP Dev Center server `sapes5.sapdevcenter.com`

1. Clone this repo
2. Change into the repo's `build_test_crate` subdirectory.
3. Create a `.env` file containing your userid and password in the following format
   ```env
   SAP_USER=<your userid>
   SAP_PASSWORD=<your password>
   ```
4. Run `cargo run`
5. Open your browser and go to <http://localhost:8080>
6. You will see the entity set `BusinessPartnerSet` belonging to the OData service `GWSAMPLE_BASIC` displayed in JSON format.

```json
{
  "d": {
    "results": [
      {
        "__metadata": {
        "id": "https://SAPES5.SAPDEVCENTER.COM:443/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/BusinessPartnerSet('0100000000')",
        "uri": "https://SAPES5.SAPDEVCENTER.COM:443/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/BusinessPartnerSet('0100000000')",
        "type": "GWSAMPLE_BASIC.BusinessPartner",
        "etag": "W/\"datetime'2023-08-09T05%3A31%3A57.3627400'\""
      },
      "Address": {
        "__metadata": {
        "type": "GWSAMPLE_BASIC.CT_Address"
      },
      "City": "Walldorf",
      "PostalCode": "69190",
      "Street": "Dietmar-Hopp-Allee",
      "Building": "16",
      "Country": "DE",
      "AddressType": "02"
    },
    "BusinessPartnerID": "0100000000",

  <SNIP>
```
